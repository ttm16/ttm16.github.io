            <h4>
                So as stated in the previous page titled " This is where I speak on my education" I would have given a brief synopsis on my education so in 
                addition to  that I am from the small island of Jamaica <a href="https://www.visitjamaica.com/"> Visit more information on
                Jamaica </a> born and raise in the parish of Clarendon, <a href="https://jis.gov.jm/information/parish-profiles/parish-profile-clarendon/"> Visit more information on
                Clarendon </a>, while growing up my parents wasn't the richest so they
                started a small wholesale business in the May Pen market with what they have by the I graduated the institiution of Wood Hall Basic School I was 
                registered at The May Pen primary School because of the close proximity at my parents school when I wasn't at school I would be studying to catch up because
                at that time I was behind in schoool and in addition to that I will help my parents to sell their products especailly on weekends. When I reach the high school 
                level I experience bullying which I later overcome by learning about the world more when I reach 6th form when the pandemic hits I start to take up the hobby
               of reading in  my freetime for the sake of learning more about myself, and the world   and exercising for the sake of my health
               Three of my major strength is my determination, my ability to think logically and my self discipline

         <center><h1> What I have learnt from the 12 pillas of success</h1>
        
        <p> <h4>In Chapter 4, (achieving your goals), the chapter's title refers to how you can achieve your objectives. 
        Reading this chapter helps me understand that thinking about and making goals is what makes you attain the life you want,
        and it is never too late to start thinking about yours. The power of writing personal goals down is not just the process of
        defining what they are, but when goals are written down, you are more likely to achieve them since your mind is cognitively
        aware of them and begins to think of ways to attain them. The main reason for making goals is not what you 
        will achieve but what you will become in the course of attaining them. Goals will make you grow, and you will 
        become a better person as a result. Arranging goals in the categories of medium, long-term, and micro goals is
        critical to getting where you want to go in life; these diverse goals are what will lead you to your final goal. According to
        Chapter 5, "The Proper Use of Time," you must always make time for what is important while paying attention to what is urgent, 
        because if you only pay attention to what is urgent and not what is vital, then regret will be unavoidable, but if one disciplines 
        oneself to take opportunities of time, then one can strive for the dream that one wishes to live. One should make the most of their 
        time before they wake up on their deathbed, weak and frail, with nothing to alleviate the crushing anguish of regret that they are
        experiencing in their final moments. As a result, it is critical for one to be the master of their time rather than allowing time 
        to be the master of them, which will cause you to fall into a plan that someone else has designed for you, which is not ideal. 
        "Surround yourself with the best people," says Chapter 6. In this chapter, I realized that the people I hang out with influence my 
        attitude toward life and aid to influence the goals that we set for ourselves. As a result, one should choose to surround 
        themselves with winners and people who encourage them to be a better version of themselves. The questions that I will ask myself 
        when selecting my circle on the path to success are, "How will they impact me? What will they push me to read? What kind of 
        conversation will take place? What are the objectives and locations that will be accomplished? What kind of worldview will I adopt?
        After questioning and answering these questions, it occurred to me that, while I share common goals with some of my friends, there
        are some with whom I will need to disassociate and others with whom I will need to limit myself because they are not contributing 
        to where I want to be a decade from now. Some of my relationships have been advantageous to my path, while others have been neutral
        or have put me at a disadvantage. The type of friendships that I am attempting to cultivate are those that surround me with 
        possibilities, knowledge, and ideas since they will impact and help to adapt the personality that I will require in order to reach
        my goals. "Be a lifelong learner," Chapter 7 A college degree will get you a job, but it will not get you to all of your life goals.
        To be a successful person, you must be a lifelong learner, whether it is by reading, making mistakes, talking with someone who has
        more life experience than you, or with a successful person who inspires you.
        The term "unethical practice" includes any form of wrongdoing. Personality tests can cause problems in the workplace because
        they are considered immoral and even destructive to the organization (O'Grady, 2017). Personality tests are frequently unreliable due
        to candidates falsifying the findings, which leads employers to hire the most incompetent employee (Mujtaba, 2015). As a result, using
        the results of a personality test to screen employees is unethical. Another reason why a personality test is unreliable is that it is
        occasionally taken twice with the same response and yields a different result. Moral difficulties may arise if an employee is denied 
        participation in a project because his supervisor made an arbitrary decision about their qualifications based only on their
        personality type (McIntosh, 2022). (O'Grady, 2017) feels that by using personality tests to screen personnel, firms are recruiting
        like-minded employees, reducing creativity and diversity, which is essentially a discriminatory act. It would be unfair for 
        someone with an introverted temperament to be judged by a test and not be able to be employed or be promoted, even if they were 
        the superior candidate for the job. People should be chosen for a job based on their talents and skills, not their personalities.
        This is why the Myers-Briggs Code of Professional Practice says that using the MBTI to hire or promote people is unethical.</h4></p> </center>
